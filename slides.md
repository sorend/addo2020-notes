# SRE/SLO talks - take-aways

(Why? Bankdata focus on SLAs, but not doing it)

- SLOs are great, especially the error-budget.
  - It's not only about reliability. Also use it for:
  - Driving experiments/innovation.
  - Driving understanding of services.
- Metrics everywhere.
- Build rich dashboards include much of value-stream as possible.

# DevOps in regulated domains - take-aways

(Why? Could be part of Bankdata's DevOps journey)

- Automate everywhere.
- Collect data everywhere.
- Rich dashboards on collected data documents process.
- Continuous auditing answers "legacy" audits.
- Think security and auditing into products/processes.
- Collaborate with audit/security/developers.

# K8s edge routing - take-aways

(Why? To get knowledge)

- Talks from two products: Gloo (supergloo) and Ambassador.
- Too many interesting concepts, a few:
  - out-of-process, in/out load balancing, observabilit, k8s-native.
- Bankdata is "2010s" :-)
