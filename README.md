## Keynotes

### Ask me anything keynote: CI/CD
(Cloudbees + HSBC engineers)

* CI/CD: Automation is about removing friction. Possiblity to go through a process as fast as possible.
* Business perspective: Cultural shift. Continuous everything, we want to do our best.
* Going faster means breaking less, smaller releases. Business is impacted of going faster.
* Regulatory impact. Controls are codified and deploys together with code. Engineers don't think about it, it just happens.
* Complete views of what is met and what is not met automatically all the time.
* Goal centric approach over tools centric approach.
* Principles for CD: Break pieces down in small pieces. Release + monitor small parts + automated roll-back + gradual roll-outs.
* How do you think about releasing code?
* How to convince upper management? Customer value stream + reduce turmoil.
* Champions are required, to drive progress.
