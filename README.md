# All Day Devops 2020 notes


## Keynotes

### Ask me anything keynote: CI/CD
(Cloudbees + HSBC engineers)

* CI/CD: Automation is about removing friction. Possiblity to go through a process as fast as possible.
* Business perspective: Cultural shift. Continuous everything, we want to do our best.
* Going faster means breaking less, smaller releases. Business is impacted of going faster.
* Regulatory impact. Controls are codified and deploys together with code. Engineers don't think about it, it just happens.
* Complete views of what is met and what is not met automatically all the time.
* Goal centric approach over tools centric approach.
* Principles for CD: Break pieces down in small pieces. Release + monitor small parts + automated roll-back + gradual roll-outs.
* How do you think about releasing code?
* How to convince upper management? Customer value stream + reduce turmoil.
* Champions are required, to drive progress.

* Set a goal for yourself. Start small. Measure everything. You have to do it. Build community around it. Make it public (advertise it).


## Sessions

### Are we really moving faster? How visualizing flow changed the way we work
(Roman Pickl, Elektrobit)

* Are we really moving faster?  AFTER the journey to K8s with monitoring.
* Problem: Delivering value
* Impediments: Long dev cycles, high workloads, changing priorities, decreasing morale
* Fast physical feedback and visibility of problems
* Clear feedback signals.
* Ambient awareness: Extreme feedback devices (physical feedback devices in highly visible locations)
* Provoke conversation, show nothing to hide. Traces back to your production system.
* Weekly status meeting regarding Operations.
* "We shape our buildings, and afterwards our building shape us".
* Dashboard metrics: Open pull requests, open support requests, tickets in progress, tickets done but not released.
* Confluence does not provide value until developer sees them.
* High variability in design domain, low variability in delivery domain
* Flow framework: Flow load (items worked on), Flow time (time through valuestream), Flow efficiency (actively worked on), Flow velocity (number done), Flow distribution (allocation in specific state) -> Flow-board + happiness + quality :-)
* Separate Features vs bugfix.
* Local optimization and the urgency paradox (measure the full value-stream, not only the development section where things are pushed to go fast).
* Value vs non-value adding activities. Goal eliminate, optimize. Use value-stream mapping technique.
